\subsection{Deciding if an even integer N is the sum of two primes}
For clarity further along - we begin with a simple utility \textbf{isPrime} that via primitive trial division method determines if an input candidate number $C$ is prime.

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
	\REQUIRE $C \geq 0$
	\IF{$C = 1 \text{ \textbf{or} } C = 2$}
		\RETURN 1
	\ENDIF
	\STATE $f \leftarrow C - 1$
	\WHILE{$f > 1$}
		\IF{$f \mid C$}
				\RETURN 1
		\ENDIF
		\STATE $f \leftarrow f - 1$
	\ENDWHILE
	\RETURN 0
\end{algorithmic}

If it is not clear, we \textbf{return} to indicate the returning of a value to a potential caller. Suppose this algorithm runs on it's own, we interpret \textbf{return} as a \textbf{print} followed by a \textbf{stop}.

\subsubsection*{Is Goldbach number algorithm}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
	\REQUIRE $N > 2 \text{ \textbf{and} } 2 \nmid N$
	\STATE $c \leftarrow N - 1$
	\WHILE{$c > 2$}
		\IF{\textbf{isPrime(c)}}
			\STATE $c' \leftarrow N - c$
			\IF{\textbf{isPrime(c')}}
				\RETURN 1
			\ENDIF
		\ENDIF
		\STATE $c \leftarrow c - 1$
	\ENDWHILE
	\RETURN 0
\end{algorithmic}


\subsection{Does the above halt?}
We shall first prove that for any $C > 0$, \textbf{isPrime} halts. It's tediously obvious as $f$ is clearly monotonically decreasing towards a bound of 1. It will inevitably reach this bound and exit the only loop then halt, if not halting beforehand.

We use this result of \textbf{isPrime} directly for the main algorithm. Similarly to above $c$ is monotonically decreasing towards a bound of 2. It will inevitably reach this bound and exit the only loop and halt, if not halting beforehand.

\subsection{Does the proposed algorithm in the assignment solve the Goldbach conjecture?}
Yes. I'm heading to Faber and Faber to pick up my cool million dollars. \textbf{I am ofcourse kidding}.

\section{Research Question}
In reference to John Baez; Computing the uncomputable blog post re: Joel David Hamkins result.

\subsection{The main result}
In lectures we have discovered the existence of some incomputable functions. Concretely the halting function which is considered close enough to a $f: N \rightarrow N$ (an expression of the halting problem) for instance. The result published by Joel David Hamkins asserts that indeed \textbf{any function can be computable}... which at first presumes a conflict with our finding and perhaps a solution to the halting problem.

Under close inspection we realise that he shows the existence of a turing machine $T$ that \textbf{there is a model of PA such that in this model}, if we give $T$ any standard natural $n$ as input, it halts and computes $f(n)$.

\subsection{My interpretation of Joel David Hamkins result}
\subsection{Does the main result contradict the Halting Theorem?}


\section{Mathematical Modelling}
\subsection{Monochromatic arithmetic progressions}
First, we define concretely what it means for an "infinite binary sequence contains a monochromatic arithmetic progression of \emph{any} length". 

Given a infinite binary sequence $s = s_{1}s_{2}s_{3}...$ and some $k>0$ we say there $\exists i,t \geq 1$ such that $s_{i}s_{i+t}s_{i+2t}...s_{i+(k-1)t}$ is $\in \{1^k,0^k\}$.

\subsection{Does every infinite sequence contain a monochromatic arithmetic progression?}
A pretty vacuous application of the \textbf{finite Van der Waerden theorem}. Give me your infinite binary sequence $s$ and desired $k$ value. In close relation to the theorem delivery, fix $c = 2$ (colouring). By thereom, there $\exists \gamma$ such that the prefix of length $\gamma + 1$ has a monochromatic arithmetic progression of length $k$.

\subsection{And for ternary sequences?} 
Given a infinite ternary sequence $s = s_{1}s_{2}s_{3}...$ and some $k>0$ we say there $\exists i,t \geq 1$ such that $s_{i}s_{i+t}s_{i+2t}...s_{i+(k-1)t}$ is $\in \{1^k,2^k,0^k\}$.

Verbatim the exact same proof applied (heavy reliance on the finite Van der Waerden theorem), where we now fix $c = 3$.
