\subsection{Deciding if an even integer N is the sum of two primes}
For clarity further along - we begin with a simple utility \textbf{isPrime} that via primitive trial division method determines if an input candidate number $C$ is prime.

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
	\REQUIRE $C \geq 0$
	\IF{$C = 1 \text{ \textbf{or} } C = 2$}
		\RETURN 1
	\ENDIF
	\STATE $f \leftarrow C - 1$
	\WHILE{$f > 1$}
		\IF{$f \mid C$}
				\RETURN 1
		\ENDIF
		\STATE $f \leftarrow f - 1$
	\ENDWHILE
	\RETURN 0
\end{algorithmic}

If it is not clear, we \textbf{return} to indicate the returning of a value to a potential caller. Suppose this algorithm runs on it's own, we interpret \textbf{return} as a \textbf{print} followed by a \textbf{stop}.

\subsubsection*{Is Goldbach number algorithm}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
	\REQUIRE $N > 2 \text{ \textbf{and} } 2 \nmid N$
	\STATE $c \leftarrow N - 1$
	\WHILE{$c > 2$}
		\IF{\textbf{isPrime(c)}}
			\STATE $c' \leftarrow N - c$
			\IF{\textbf{isPrime(c')}}
				\RETURN 1
			\ENDIF
		\ENDIF
		\STATE $c \leftarrow c - 1$
	\ENDWHILE
	\RETURN 0
\end{algorithmic}


\subsection{Does the above halt?}
We shall first prove that for any $C > 0$, \textbf{isPrime} halts. It's tediously obvious as $f$ is clearly monotonically decreasing towards a bound of 1. It will inevitably reach this bound and exit the only loop then halt, if not halting beforehand.

We use this result of \textbf{isPrime} directly for the main algorithm. Similarly to above $c$ is monotonically decreasing towards a bound of 2. It will inevitably reach this bound and exit the only loop and halt, if not halting beforehand.

\subsection{Does the proposed algorithm in the assignment solve the Goldbach conjecture?}
Yes. I'm heading to Faber and Faber to pick up my cool million dollars. \textbf{I am ofcourse kidding}.

\section{Research Question}
My interpretation of Joel David Hamkins proof via reference to John Baez; Computing the uncomputable blog post: a summation of Joel David Hamkins (and friends like Woodin) result.

\subsection{The main result}
There is \textbf{a} Turing machine $T$ that when given any function $f: N \rightarrow N$, there is a model of Peano Axioms (PA), such that in this model, if we give $T$ any \emph{standard} natural $n$ as input, it halts and outputs $f(n)$.

\subsubsection{Preliminaries}
A model of PA is a mere triple $(N, 0, S)$, where $N$ is a set, $0 \in N$ and $S: N \rightarrow N$ satisfies the PA the precise "structure" of $N$ and $S$ is up to interpretation (although it is worth noting that $N$ is necessarily infinite). We are all aware of the "standard" PA model, and so I won't dwell. What we need to do is speak about "non-standard" models of PA - construction originally driven by the works of Löwenheim–Skolem. The existence of such models are initial segment isomorphic to the "standard" natural numbers. Initial segment isomorphism suggests the existence of an \emph{upper set} of elements that, as John Baez puts it, are "tacked" on the end of the set of "standard" natural numbers. Somewhat concretely I view these "non-standard" numbers as having the property that they are strictly greater than $0$ and every element of the model you can reach from 0 by applying $S$ (\textbf{finitely} many times). However, these elements still obey all the axioms of PA (which nessecerailly pushes an infinite size of this upper set also).

John Baez points out that a sentence $p$ in such a model is merely provable, or not provable, and factually speaking it either holds or doesn't hold - importantly \textbf{relative} to the adopted model we're using to interpret $p$.

\subsubsection{Notes on the construction of proof}
The proof itself uses Rosser sentences, which themselves say: "For any proof of this sentence in a theory, there is a smaller proof of the negation of this sentence". The proof described in the original Hamkins blog derives \textbf{a single} Turing machine $T$ that systematically \emph{builds a model of arithmetic} via an infinite sequence of these Rosser sentences and their negations that entirely depend on the given $f$. The original turing machine $T$ then \textbf{via this created arithmetic model} expresses this function $f$ on it's standard input domain. That means that this Turing machine halts and computes $f(n)$ for all standard $n \in N$.

\subsubsection{Contradicting the Halting Theorem?}
This draws an interesting contrast to the halting theorem. Indeed the halting decider is just a mere function of shape $h: N \times N \rightarrow N$ that takes a program $p$ and input $n$ pair and returns "true" ($1$) or "false" ($0$), interpretted as if the program with input halts or not. We can systematically encode the program itself alongside it's input, and hence bijectively map this $N \times N$ input to just $N$, and so we really have this halting decider function $h: N \times N$.

Well then, here we apply this theorem provided by Hamkin and indeed use this magical Turing machine $T$, then within a model of PA, say $M = (\xi,0,S)$, which we can compute the result of $h$ given any standard input. The turing machine halts and prints $f(n)$. Concretely we mean that the machine halts after some $\eta \in \xi$ steps. Note we cannot with certainty rule out that $M$ is indeed a "non-standard" model of PA, $\eta$ could be very well contained in the upper set $\gamma \subseteq \xi$ such that if there is no "finite set" of application of $S$ on $0$ that can reach $\eta$.

Needless to say then, it appears we do not have in front of us a program solving in "finite" time the Halting problem for every input.

\section{Mathematical Modelling}
\subsection{Monochromatic arithmetic progressions}
First, we define concretely what it means for an "infinite binary sequence contains a monochromatic arithmetic progression of \emph{any} length". 

Given a infinite binary sequence $s = s_{1}s_{2}s_{3}...$ and some $k>0$ we say there $\exists i,t \geq 1$ such that $s_{i}s_{i+t}s_{i+2t}...s_{i+(k-1)t}$ is $\in \{1^k,0^k\}$.

\subsection{Does every infinite sequence contain a monochromatic arithmetic progression?}
A pretty vacuous application of the \textbf{finite Van der Waerden theorem}. Give me your infinite binary sequence $s$ and desired $k$ value. In close relation to the theorem delivery, fix $c = 2$ (colouring). By thereom, there $\exists \gamma$ such that the prefix of length $\gamma + 1$ has a monochromatic arithmetic progression of length $k$.

\subsection{And for ternary sequences?} 
Given a infinite ternary sequence $s = s_{1}s_{2}s_{3}...$ and some $k>0$ we say there $\exists i,t \geq 1$ such that $s_{i}s_{i+t}s_{i+2t}...s_{i+(k-1)t}$ is $\in \{1^k,2^k,0^k\}$.

Verbatim the exact same proof applied (heavy reliance on the finite Van der Waerden theorem), where we now fix $c = 3$.
