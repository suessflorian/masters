\section*{Parameterized and Approximation Algorithms}
Tackle NP complete problems in an exact way. Next two weeks... design and complexity (np-hardness, np-completeness).

Choose a paper that is about an algorithm (and some algorithmic idea) as opposed to understanding the complexity...

\subsection{NP (non-deterministic polynomial) Recall}
{\bf np-easy} is a function problem that are solvable in polynomial time. Whereas {\bf np-hard} is a function problem where all known algorithms for a function problem have exponential complexity

\section{Dominating Set (DS) Problem}
A graph $G=(V,E)$ and a non-negative integer $k$. Question. Is there a subset $V\prime \subseteq V$ such that $|V\prime| \leq k$ and each vertex in $V\\V\prime$ is adjacent to at least one vertex in $V\prime$.

This is np-complete (np-hard)
