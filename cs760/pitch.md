## Independent and Identically distributed random variables
A collection of random variables is independent and identically distributed if each random variable has the same probability distribution as the others and all are mutually independent.

Less verbose; each datapoint in a dataset is drawn from the same global distribution of whatever this domain is.

## Means
By definition, models are susceptible to inputs that violate "IDD". Can we craft inputs in such a way that by glance appear "normal" but by nuance detriment the performance of a naive "IDD" assuming model.

# Adversarial Machine Learning (Adv. ML)
The study of techniques that demonstrate ML vulnerabilities. The "cybersecurity of ML".
