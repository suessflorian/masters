# CS760 - Advanced Topics in ML
Easily the most interesting paper of the lot... here you properly learn the fundamentals behind deep learning.

It's quite academic aware, referencing truly breakthrough papers in the field. I'll curate a library of the best papers in the `./whitepapers` directory (ones that are directly relevant to the course and extra's I found).

I also found extremely helpful this playlist over here too by [`3Blue1Brown`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) as a primer and for content extra I do appreciate the [`MIT 6.S191`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDX-1M5Nj7s&list=PLtBw6njQRU-rwp5__7C0oIVt26ZgjG9NI) course a good hit too.
