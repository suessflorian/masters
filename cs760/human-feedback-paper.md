( **Research on training language models to follow instructions with human feedback** )

- Very long paper (>50 pages)
## Research
- Question, how can LM's interpret and execute user instructions while maintaining adherence to ethical guidelines and avoiding harm
- What methods and frameworks can be developed to reduce the incidence of untruthful, biased, or harmful outputs generated by LM's
- How can fine-tuning with human feedback address the mismatch between traditional language modelling objectives and following user instructions helpfully and safely?

## Motivation
### Enhancing practical utility;
- Improve the functionality and usability of LM's in diverse applications.
- Align LM's more closely with human intent to make them more integral and beneficial across various contexts.
- Enhancing UX and fostering more effective human-computer interactions.

### Promoting Ethical Alignment and Trust;
- Ensuring LM's operate within ethical boundaries by respecting principles of truthfulness, non-maleficence and fairness.
- Addressing biased content genration to align with ethical standards and build trust among users and stakeholders.
- Ethical alignment for the widespread adoption and acceptance of LMs.

### Mitigating Societal Risksl
- Recognizing the potential harms of misaligned LM's
- Developing methods to fine-tune LM's with human feedback to address these risks proactively
- Mitigate societal risks to enhance the resposible dev and deployment of AI

### Advancing AI Alignment Research
- Contributing insights, methodologies, and empirical evidence to the field of AI alignment.
- Align LMs and other AI forms with human values and intentions.
- Seek for sophisticated models capable of ethical reasoning and decision making aligned with human norms and preferences.

---
- Improvements through targeted fine-tuning.
- Explores RLHF (reinforcement learning human feedback) as a method for fine-tuning LM's.
- Relevance to AI safety and ethics.

## Significant of research
Foundation within ML methodologies and its reponse to pressing ethical concerns in AI.
- Progress towrads creating LN's that are not only technologically advanced but also ethically and socially responsible.
