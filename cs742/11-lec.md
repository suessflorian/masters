(10th August Week 4)

# Continuing on "Comparative Analysis of Web and P2P traffic"
We begin a little about the power log distribution. Characterisation of a heavy tail.

## ZIPF distribution
Rank frequency domain. Interchangeable with power-law distribution. Drawn for discrete values. RANK-FREQUENCY domain, you can draw it as a CDF, to see ZIPF needs rank-frequency domain. Simple definition: items are ranked, in descending order of their probability (same as frequency) - then the frequency of the items is inversely proportional to the rank of the item.

In essence, while the definition might sound tautological, the "big highlight" of Zipf's law is its ubiquity and the specific power-law relationship it defines, which isn't an inherent or obvious outcome from just ranking items by frequency. It's this unexpected consistency across vastly different types of data that makes Zipf's law so intriguing.

## Question and answers
Meant to give a bit of a review of things covered recently. "We should expect similar questions in exams etc...". Includes calculations? The questions given are simplistic and are about "flow".

Interesting question "are there any heavy hitters"; have to look at the **transfer volume** for each of the hosts. Look at percentage share then identify if/what host(s) are taking a large share of the transfer (apparently to be "obvious"). Transfer rate; MB/s. _Note: there's a lot of unit conversion crap_.
