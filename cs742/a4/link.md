# LINK BUDGET

## Facts
Point to point distance;
- My house, has ambient noise at natural noise floor.
- The Auckland Sky Tower, has ambient noise 20dB above natural noise floor.
- Required 6dB fade margin
- Link frequency 3GHz
- The data rate must be 50MBits per second
- Distance ~2,920m
- The available bandwidth: 7.14MHz
- 6dB Fade Margin on both ends
- Hottest temperature recorded in Auckland 34 degrees + 273.15

## Required components
For ease, lets just imagine a skytower to home transmission, we will look at the other side later.

- Transmitter (output power)
- Transmitter feedline 
- Transmitter antenna gain
- Path loss, need to radius 2,920m, wavelength to be determined
- Receiver antenna gain
- Receiver feedline
- Need to find minimum SNR required
- Need to take into account noise floor
