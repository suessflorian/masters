(18th August Friday Week 5)

Few more ideas for reference;
- Reverse Traceroute, paths are asymmetric of network traffic. There have been tools to look at that reverse path. (available)
- Starlink Internet Performance, _mentioned already_. [CLAIMED]
- Broadband performance [CLAIMED]
- IP Geolocation, "how to perform it accurately" (available)

## Continuing "Characterizing the File Hosting Ecosystem: A View from the Edge"
- Interestingly, using ping delay of destination IP's logged to determine geographic categorisation. (shortest ping method).

## Content fragmentation came up
- Interestingly content is highly fragmented **between file hosting services**
- Content hosted on P2P is an order of magnitude larger than file hosting services.

## Exam Preparation.
All papers (6-7) covered will be assessed in the exam...
- Workload Characterization (measurements both passive/active, vantage points various)
- Pinging in the Rain (pings to understand weather related outages)
- Web Complexity (complexity of modern websites # objects, servers etc...)
- Wi-Fi Interference (microwave, analog cameras etc...)
- Comparative Analysis on Web and P2P, flow ([ size, duration ] => rate, ita) and host levels (flow concurrency, transfer volume => rate, geographic location) - mice and elephant flow's and "heavy hitters"
    - Power law / ZIPF
- Facebook Photo Caching "Improved Cache Eviction Policy"
    - Hierarchy of distribution
- Characterizing File Hosting Ecosystem
