It does this by iterating through all combinations of hyper parameters and evaluating those hyper parameters by k-fold cross validation. Each run giving an aggregated (mean) accuracy score of the model trained under the regulation of those hyperparameters, later used for comparing different hyperparameter combination effectiveness.\n",
