It does this by iterating through all combinations of hyper parameters and evaluating those hyper parameters by k-fold cross validation. Each run giving an aggregated (mean) accuracy score of the model trained under the regulation of those hyperparameters, later used for comparing different hyperparameter combination effectiveness.\n",

    "From the importing of the data, we know that the given dataset for website-fishing is significantly bigger (wrt. row count) than the arrythmia and bcp. This could explain why the unpruned tree for the website-fishing dataset is significantly more complex (wrt. to number of tree nodes). This would suggest there is \"more to trim\" on website-fishing dataset however the hyper parameter search of alpha re: cost complexity pruning technique showed that we cannot remove \"much\" from this dataset (12 nodes of 899). This suggests to me that the samples at the bottom of the tree are still quite entropic compared to the arrythmia and bcp; where a significant proportion of their overall trees could be trimmed (104 nodes of 125 and 28 nodes of 49). This would suggest less relative entropy through the bottom of those trees."

    "# (Task 4) Evaluating these Models\n",
    "It's time to formally evaluate these three models... the one `getFittedAlphaTunedClassifier`, `getTrainedUnprunedClassifier` and `getTrainedStumpClassifier`. The absolute performance of these models are to be considered and you can quite easily fit each model on the `training` data provided and go ahead and predict the labels on these unseen `testing` features, finding the [`accuracy_score`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score.html) of each model and comparing this way. It's very important to keep in mind other very useful evaluation metrics such as [precision](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.precision_score.html#sklearn.metrics.precision_score), and [recall](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.recall_score.html). These metrics as per mentioned in course can be used to further expand on particular evaluation behaviours of models, perhaps we would prefer models that over classify positive in a binary classification realm, or instead be overly cautious.\n",
