\section{Reviewed Discretization}
Can be used for smoothing, and also categorical analysis on an otherwise continuous attribute. That is a top-down approach, and it is unsupervised as it is not directly looking at class labels. Binning, we mentioned, equi-width (prone to skewed data), equi-frequency (not prone to skewed data).

\section{Correlation Analysis (12min - 19min)}
Supervised, bottom-up merging. Qi-merge.
