# Foundation in Machine Learning
At the time of taking, this course was extremely dense in material - real gold mine. I've downloaded all the recordings locally (35 really well done hour long lectures presented by Jorg, Katerina and Thomas). I didn't realise how important the material in this course was until I got heavily into deep learning via CS760 (which I had only got around to about a year later).

CS760 was good, but material was so short, where we instead invested a lot of class time looking at various different whitepapers, which was alright - but not quite the same as well crafted lecture content this trio provided. I realised that my venture into deep learning was a bit disrespectful to the classical approaches - in particular some unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering. Or the simple idea's behind Markov chaining etc... which underpins some theoreticals behind Transformer models.
