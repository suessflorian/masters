    "This assignment consists of two problems presented in a puzzle game context. For the first problem, you will be implementing a path search problem along with common search algorithms and evaluating their properties. For the second problem, you will be exploring how to define and solve a constraint satisfaction problem. To implement the solutions, you have to use AIPython code that provides you with many implemented classes and examples of their use.  \n",
