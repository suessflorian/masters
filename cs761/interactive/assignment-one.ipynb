    "This assignment consists of two problems presented in a puzzle game context. For the first problem, you will be implementing a path search problem along with common search algorithms and evaluating their properties. For the second problem, you will be exploring how to define and solve a constraint satisfaction problem. To implement the solutions, you have to use AIPython code that provides you with many implemented classes and examples of their use.  \n",

Interestly we see Manhattan also over-estimates in the start17 scenario. The corollaries being the **inadmissibility** of both the Manhattan and Inversions heuristic. Meaning we risk solution optimality when using these two heuristics.\n",
