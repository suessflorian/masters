# Recall the PEAS Model

- **Performance Measure**; we need task motivation. This can come in the form of an arbitrary set of goals, functions that indicate progress to a desired state. 
- **Environment**; the characteristics of an environment. Typically describable via a set of finite well known traits;
  - simulated vs situated
	- dynamic vs static
  - stochastic vs deterministic (static environment restricts to deterministic)
	- finite vs infinite
	- fully observable vs partially observable
	- episodic vs sequential
	- known vs unknown
	- single-agent vs multi-agent
- **Actuators**; the agents scope of capability, typically a finite set of actions can be performed, these defined by the agents set of actuators.
- **Sensors**; the agents ability to comprehend the situation.
