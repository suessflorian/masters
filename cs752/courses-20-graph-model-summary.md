# Summary

1. Simple Graph
2. Directed Graph (ordered pair of vertices)
	1. Data Graph (assigning data to vertices)
	2. Weighted Graph (assigning data to edges)
	3. RDF Graph (resource description framework) (MULTI-GRAPH)
		1. RDF Datasets (Hyper vertices)

Now merging directed graph, data graph, weighted graph and RDF graphs we get
**Blueprints PGM**.

Multiple vertex labels, we get Neo4j/PGQL PGM. This preceeds **PGM** that we know about.

Then we arrive at OSPGM, OPPGM. Note OSPGM, we get HYPGM.

We also explored in course 19, HEPGM.

## PGM itself has a good balance between expressiveness (compared to extensions covered).
