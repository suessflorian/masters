Turning subgraphs into objects. Objectified Supgraph PGM, OSPGM

Note a PGM can have zero subgraphs, hence OSPGM is a strict generalizations over PGM.
## Same for OPPGM?

- `G in O` where G is called set of subgraphs

introduce:
`γ : G → P(V) x P(E)` is a total function assigning to every subgraph a pair of vertex set and edge set,

Then just like oopgm, we adapt

Note that means we adapt 
- `λ : (V ∪ E ∪ G) -> P(L)`.
- `ν : (V ∪ E ∪ G) x K -> N`
