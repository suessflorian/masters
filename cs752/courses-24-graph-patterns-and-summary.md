# Relationship
Mostly a summary course... Trivially introduced `UCRPQ`.

- `RPQ ⊂ CRPQ ⊂ UCRPQ`
- `CQ ⊂ CRPQ`
- `RPQ !⊆ CQ` (CQ restricts it's expressions to single labels only)
- `CQ !⊆ RPQ` (RPQ restricts to a single expression at a time, returning a strict tuple return)

There was also mention of an alternative visual representation of `CRPQ` queries, where we essentially draft a `pattern` that illustrates the query. We can overlay this over top of the graph this query is actually being evaluated on.
