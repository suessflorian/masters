Hyper vertices PGM, HVPGM. The basic idea is that subgraph are considered the same as a vertex.

Well-formed:
for all v in `V`, all edges of `v` are adjacent to vertices of `v`

`Î³ : V->P(V)xP(E)` is a total function assigning to every hypervertex a pair of hypervertex set and edge set.

### Note the similarities between HVPGM and OSPGM.
