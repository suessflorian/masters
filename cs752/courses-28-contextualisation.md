# Contextualisation
Filter out those nodes in a graph that do not have an outgoing path selected by `e`.

`[[π(e)]]G = {(s,s) | ∃t∈V such that (s,t) ∈[[e]]G}`

Similar to projections in RGPA, where you can select certain node's (src, dest etc..). But dumbed down to only `RPQ`s. 

Note: response is tuples.
