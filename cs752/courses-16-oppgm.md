Objectified Paths PGM - OPPGM

- Turning Paths into Objects

`P` element of `O`, are to be paths (as they are now objects)

`delta: P -> U(n>=0) E^n`, total function assigning to every path (in `P`) a sequence of edges.

Note that means we adapt 
- `lambda: (V u E u P) -> P(L)`.
- `v: (V u E u P) x K -> N`
