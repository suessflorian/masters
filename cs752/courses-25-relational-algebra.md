# Relational Algebra
It's an extension of what we know about `RPQ`

Note `RA` is extended in the following two ways:
- there exists an identiy element:
concretely:
If `g = id` => `[[g]]G = {(a,a) | a in V}`
- additively closed
for all, `x,y` in `RA`, then `x + y in RA` (note since for all `x in RA`, `-x in RA`, we can also write this as for all `x,y` in `RA` => `x - y in RA`.

Note: `e intersect f` <=> `e - (e - f)`. (for some reason I don't intuitvely follow, makes sense on small examples though)
