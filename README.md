# Masters Journey
> I’m going to be 29 anyways, so I might as well be 29 with a Master’s.
[- what sparked this thought](https://alexanderell.is/posts/mscs/)

## History
I hated maths before starting university in 2015, I actively avoided doing calculus in my final year of high school... When the time came, I enrolled in a bachelors of science with a broad attendance in statistics, classical physics, organic chemistry, introduction to accounting (yuck), psychology, medical sciences, computer science and math mostly because it was a pre-requisite to my subscribed computer science major. The idea was to essentially build as much exposure as I could before diving into a deeper specialisation.

[Dr Steven Galbraith](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/s-galbraith) who was substituting for the regular lecturer that led the delivery for COMPSCI 225, Discrete Structures in Maths; An introduction to the foundations of computer science from a rigorous mathematical logic sense and [Dr Tanya Evans](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/t-evans) who led the delivery for MATHS 150; a course spending time on the basics, linear algebra and single variable real calculus absolutely bamboozled me. I weirdly enjoyed exploring mathematical systems with them. Deeply and genuinely. **I learnt that mathematics was ridiculously creative** and I began building very high levels of confidence that nothing is ever too mystic to understand, a complete 180 to where my thoughts used to be. After that first year, I dropped my interest in computer science and went to only do pure mathematics;

- Principles (set theory, proofs, relations, vector spaces, sequences)
- Logic (predicate and first order)
- Differential (more applied, simultaneous systems)
- Algebraic Structures (groups, rings, vector spaces)
- Real Analysis (revisiting first year stuff axiomatically, loads of crazy cool proofs)
- Combinatorics (graph colourings, compression)

With special thanks to [Associate Professor Caroline Yoon](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/c-yoon) who delivered the entirety of MATHS 302; exploring ideas that influence mathematical education ended up building general interest sharing intuition behind problems effectively.

Other names for me to look at fondly:
- [The Crazy Good Tom ter Elst](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/t-terelst/)
- [Master Jianbei](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/j-an)

In my final year, I realised I had enough points to technically claim a major in mathematics and with my interest in software I pivoted to also finish off a computer science major, focusing on comparatively more mundane topics:

- Data Structures
- Algorithms
- Machine Architecture & Assembly
- Compilers

Although I enjoyed these topics overall, they weren't as clutch as my maths studies at the time. Everyone knew there’s a gap between academic CS and working in tech which I felt as de-motivating. But after several years in industry the classes I took ended up having a very positive influence on my career. Typically in short bursts - with a lot of revision necessary.

## Now
I figured with my experience in software engineering so far, I've built a pretty solid understanding of a few different domains. 

Degree has two parts, the extended study (Honours/PgDipSci), then the research project (dissertation/thesis) (Masters).
