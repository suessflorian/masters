# Masters Journey
> I’m going to be 29 anyways, so I might as well be 29 with a Master’s.
[- what sparked this thought](https://alexanderell.is/posts/mscs/)

## History
I was quite indifferent towards mathematics before starting university in 2015 (statistics was alright), was even rejected to my final high school's year of calculus... When the time came to embark in a Bachelors, I considered all BEng, BComm, BA and BSc - I end up with the latter; as I really wanted a broad attendance in various subjects, which led to be; statistics, classical physics, organic chemistry, introduction to accounting (yuck), psychology, medical sciences, computer science. Math _sneaked_ it's way in because it was a pre-requisite to my overall subscribed Computer Science major (and thank god it did).

Of important note; I was met with the great [Dr Steven Galbraith](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/s-galbraith) who was substituting for the regular lecturer that led the delivery for COMPSCI 225, a discrete math paper introducing some tidbit foundations of computer science, some rigor here and there and [Dr Tanya Evans](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/t-evans) who led the delivery for MATHS 150; brushing up on the basics; linear algebra, single variable real calculus. The delivery of those courses blew my mind, I had so much fun. I begun appreciating reasoning via precision, turning something ambiguous into something obvious. **I learnt that this transpilation required a ton of creativity**, and being hand held through the commonly known works of [Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton), [Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz), [Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler). After that first year, I dropped my interest in computer science completely and went on a (still arduous) journey through pure mathematics. Most favourable was my exposure to the following;

- Logic (semantic & syntactic perspectives of sentential, predicate logic, and a deep dive on young [Godels' incompleteness theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del))
- Some broad systems (Peano, Zermelo–Fraenkel Choice, styles of proofs; axiomatic, consistency dependent, inductive etc...)
- Differential equations (way more applied, qualitative, numerical methods)
- Mathematical Structures (concrete focus algebraic groups, rings and fields, [all things in Gallian's book](https://www.routledge.com/Contemporary-Abstract-Algebra/Gallian/p/book/9780367651787))
- Real Analysis (rigorously approaching the foundations underlying calculus; real fields, limits and continuity, Riemann integration).

Most impactful to me however was [Associate Professor Caroline Yoon](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/c-yoon) who delivered the entirety of MATHS 302; a meta paper focusing on mathematical education. In conjunction with tidbits from my general paper EDUC 121G; how people learn. It built a long term general interest in the tricky craft of sharing intuition behind problems.

Other names for me to look back at fondly:
- [Tom ter Elst](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/t-terelst/)
- [Master Jianbei](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/j-an)

In my final year, I realised I had enough points to technically claim a major in mathematics and with my interest in software building up from personal endeavours - I pivoted back into computer science, collecting a neat little second major;

- Quite a few papers iterating on data structures and algorithms (including some light NP-completeness theory work)
- Machine architecture ([LC3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Computer_3), assembly, compilers and language design
- Deep dive into relational calculus and RDBMS's, particular focus on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- Papers in conjunction looking holistically at system designs (closely following the works of [Kleppmann](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/))

I built an interest once I accepted that fact that there is a delineation between software engineering for industry and academia. It's **more fun and interesting than practically useful**, but at the same time - it does impacts my work because the knowledge of what's out there keeps me engaged... kinda by emphasising the interesting/recognisable details of problems I encounter in industry (making me more passionate with the approach).

## Now
With my experience software engineering so far, I've built a pretty solid understanding of a few different domains and contrasted cultures of two similar technology companies and worked on many green field and legacy systems. I'm very confident in common skill set areas; the tools I use, command over the code I write, ability to comprehend, holistic understanding of different domains in software (systems and deployment strategies) and ability to learn new things quickly. I just want more.

# Masters Degree in Parts
The aim here for me is to re-enter the academic field with a veteran like perspective on what's important and what is not, skipping papers that I know I won't gather anything from. With an already fruitful and established career on my horizon I'd decided to exit the rate race of grade hunting too, instead go for something "respectable" to align more with 80/20 rule philosophy and focus more on applicability of concepts and head into the depths of extra readings etc... I am approaching this via a split PgDipSci in Computer Science before doing a full MSc research project. I aimed for A- and ended up within the A- to A range for the precursor to the MSc. My hope of just extending my understanding of what is out there certainly worked and as I take a hiatus for a bit, my I will slowly prepare for a fun masters research project focusing on, perhaps, the ML space.

Topics this taught part of the MSc I was introduced to;

- Some theoretical limitations of parallel & distributed computing
- Some bigger data management ideas
- Tons of exposure to traditional Machine Learning approachs
- Got very deep into deep learning topics.
- Demystifying some other concepts within artificial intelligence
- Advanced algorithmic/computation complexity, I can eat some pretty hard leetcode problems now.
