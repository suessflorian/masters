# Masters Journey
> I’m going to be 29 anyways, so I might as well be 29 with a Master’s.
[- what sparked this thought](https://alexanderell.is/posts/mscs/)

## History
I was quite indifferent towards mathematics before starting university in 2015 (statistics was alright), was even rejected to my final high school's year of calculus... When the time came to embark in a Bachelors, I considered a BEng, BComm but ended up with a BSc, I did this because I wanted a broad attendance in various subjects; statistics, classical physics, organic chemistry, introduction to accounting (yuck), psychology, medical sciences, computer science. Math sneaked it's way in because it was a pre-requisite to my overall subscribed Computer Science major. The idea was to essentially build as much exposure as I could before diving into a deeper specialisation (and thank god I did). 

Of important note; I was met with the great [Dr Steven Galbraith](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/s-galbraith) who was substituting for the regular lecturer that led the delivery for COMPSCI 225, a discrete math paper introducing some tidbit foundations of computer science, some rigor here and there and [Dr Tanya Evans](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/t-evans) who led the delivery for MATHS 150; brushing up on the basics; linear algebra, single variable real calculus. The delivery of those courses blew my mind, I had so much fun. I begun appreciating reasoning via precision, turning something ambiguous into something obvious. **I learnt that this transpilation required a ton of creativity**, and being handholded through the commonly known works of [Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton), [Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz), [Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler). After that first year, I dropped my interest in computer science completely and went on a (still arduous) journey through pure mathematics. I was notably exposed to;

- Principles (set theory, proofs, relations, vector spaces, sequences) (TODO: insert mathmatcians)
- Logic (predicate and first order) (TODO: insert mathematiciains)
- Differential (more applied, simultaneous systems) (TODO: comment on application vs pure)
- Algebraic Structures (groups, rings, vector spaces) (TODO: insert mathematicians, books)
- Real Analysis (revisiting first year stuff axiomatically, loads of crazy cool proofs) (TODO: mathematicians)
- Combinatorics (graph colourings, compression) (TODO: mathematicians)

Most impactful to me however was [Associate Professor Caroline Yoon](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/c-yoon) who delivered the entirety of MATHS 302; a meta paper focusing on mathematical education. In conjunction with tidbits from my general paper EDUC 121G; how people learn. It built a long term general interest in the tricky craft of sharing intuition behind problems.

Other names for me to look at fondly:
- [The Crazy Good Tom ter Elst](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/t-terelst/)
- [Master Jianbei](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/j-an)

In my final year, I realised I had enough points to technically claim a major in mathematics and with my interest in software building up from personal endeavours - I pivoted back into computer science, collecting a neat little second major;

- Data structures and some well known algorithms
- Pretty advanced complexity analysis
- Machine Architecture ([LC3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Computer_3), Assembly, Compilers and Language Design
- Software engineering practices
- Deep dive into relational calculus

Although I enjoyed these topics overall, they weren't as clutch as my maths studies at the time. Everyone knew there’s a gap between academic CS and working in tech which I felt as de-motivating. But after several years in industry the classes I took ended up having a very positive influence on my career. Typically in short bursts - with a lot of revision necessary.

## Now
I figured with my experience in software engineering so far, I've built a pretty solid understanding of a few different domains. 

Degree has two parts, the extended study (Honours/PgDipSci), then the research project (dissertation/thesis) (Masters).
